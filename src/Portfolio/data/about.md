Hi, I'm Sreekar Mouli.

I'm an enthusiastic Software Developer currently working at [Kore.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kore-inc) in Hyderabad, India. For the company, I have developed several features like Digital Views, Digital Forms and have also build a new Application called Workflows from scratch.

As a kid, I was really interested in computers and technology in general. I was really suprised when I came across programming. That fact that you can build a software which does what you want it to do really interests me. Since then, I have been building several projects and learning new technologies.
